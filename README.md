# I.P Address AVL Tree

## Features 
* A self-balancing Binary Search Tree (BST) in C, where each node containes I.P addresses, and
designed a console interface to display detailed node attributes (alias, height, depth, parent) with real-time balance factor computation, leveraging Inorder Traversal for structured output. 

* The tree reads from a file CS531_Inet.txt and inserts the valid nodes in the AVL Tree as the initial nodes and the nodes which have errors are inserted in a separate file CS531_error-log.

* Following screenshots show some app functionalities.
